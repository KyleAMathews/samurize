The bike is also intentionally functional with standard components, like a round bar, stem, seat post collar, and English threaded external bottom bracket, designed for durability. The speaker shares their excitement for unique features of the bike, such as the bottle opener replacing the front mech. As a gravel noob, the speaker admits they can be nervous in some technical and fast downhill sections and have taken some time to learn from experienced riders and by watching Jim Powell's videos.",
